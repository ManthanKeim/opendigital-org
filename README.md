The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) is an interdisciplinary team and network of scholars who aspire to advance theories and technologies for open digital innovation. The team researches new forms of organizing the processes of innovation and learning using digital technologies. This includes, but is not limited to, open source software (OSS) communities, crowdsourcing, cloud-based science infrastructures, blockchains, peer production, and data science challenges. The overall vision is to leverage the power of distributed machines and human intelligence to empower individuals and groups to learn and develop innovative solutions for complex problems such as software development, energy conservation, and healthcare.
